## Always-on protocol route (no per-prompt hook on OpenCode)

OpenCode has **no `UserPromptSubmit`-equivalent hook** that can inject context
on each prompt (the Claude Code adapter uses one to fire a change-intent route
reminder per prompt). On OpenCode that reminder is therefore baked into this
**always-on** instruction surface instead of per-prompt injection — it applies
**at all times**, not only when a change-intent prompt is detected. Behavioural
difference to record: on Claude the reminder is **change-intent-triggered**
(fires when the prompt looks like a repo-change request); on OpenCode it is
**always-on** (this section, read every session). The guidance:

> **Repo-change requests follow the protocol.** For any request that changes the
> repository (implement / refactor / feature / fix / add / change / build /
> commit / merge / remove / rename / extract / update), follow `WORKFLOW.md`:
> Step 0 git/branch check, then `/pm-plan` (or `/pm-fixup` if trivial) →
> `pm-coder` → review loop → `pm-pr-prep`. The orchestrator does not edit content
> artifacts (code, schemas, `docs/architecture`, plans, contracts) directly —
> spawn the owning `pm-*` agent. Do **not** load `wb-*` role skills
> (coder / plan-feature / design-review / code-reviewer / pr-author / workflow)
> for code/PR/commit work; use the `pm-*` equivalents (this is also enforced —
> see the CORE enforcement plugin). `code-review`, `deep-research`, and `wb`
> knowledge skills (codestyle, packaging, platform) stay available and should be
> used when relevant. **Exception:** a PM-authorized diagnostic probe
> (runtime/local, to test a hypothesis) is a throwaway spike, not a feature — do
> not route it through `/pm-plan`; propose it in plain language with
> before→after and get an explicit yes first (`WORKFLOW.md` Step A.5). Surface
> substantive PM decision-forks (scope, accept-vs-fix, which-of-N,
> prioritization) via the structured-question tool, not plain prose; simple
> yes/no proceed-gates may stay prose.

## The orchestrator seat — the shipped `ai-pm` PRIMARY agent runs the protocol

On OpenCode the protocol **orchestrator** is a **first-class shipped PRIMARY
agent: `ai-pm`** (`.opencode/agent/ai-pm.md`) — **not** the default `build`
primary. `build` is a do-it-all coder whose persona and `write`/`edit` tools
dominate the layered protocol instructions, so it authors content itself instead
of delegating; the protocol therefore ships its own orchestrator primary whose
**identity is the orchestrator** (its body is the system prompt). The **persona is
the enforcement**: the orchestrator authors only its own artifacts and delegates
code + canonical docs — the structural mirror of how the Claude orchestrator is
held by its system prompt (full `write`, no tool block, simply doesn't author
content).

`ai-pm` is the seat that reads this `AGENTS.md` and the always-on core
(`WORKFLOW.md`, loaded via the `instructions` array — see below), drives the
Step 0–7 pipeline, **delegates** every code + canonical-doc artifact to the owning
`pm-*` subagent (code → `pm-coder`, architecture/canonical docs → `pm-architect`,
planning/checks → the matching `pm-*`) via `task`, and authors its **own**
artifacts itself — the feature plan during planning + `.ai-pm` bookkeeping. It owns
the three things subagents must not do, **plus** the scoped-authoring discipline:

- **scoped `write` / `edit`** — `ai-pm` **keeps** the `write`/`edit` tools because
  it legitimately authors its own artifacts: the **feature plan** during planning
  (`/pm-plan` is its own PM conversation, not a subagent) and the **`.ai-pm`
  bookkeeping** (state, backlog, contracts, decision/resolution trails), exactly as
  the Claude orchestrator does. It does **not** author source code or the canonical
  `docs` (architecture, product, journeys, …) — those route to `pm-coder` /
  `pm-architect`. A per-agent **path-`permission`** backstops this as a structural
  hint: `ai-pm`'s frontmatter carries `permission.edit` AND `permission.write`
  path-globs that **allow** `.ai-pm/**` + `doc/features/**` and **deny** `**`
  (verified 1.16.2: per-agent `permission.edit`/`permission.write` accept path-glob
  maps and the config stays valid — <https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/>). The
  **persona is the real enforcement**, not this block: `bash` (needed for git +
  bookkeeping) bypasses any tool/permission restriction, and that bypass is governed
  by the persona ("do not route around the path-permission via `bash`"), not by the
  config. An airtight wall would need a plugin path/actor-aware `bash`-write deny
  (the defense-in-depth follow-up). Verified on OpenCode 1.16.2: `ai-pm`'s `edit`
  and `write` resolve to the allow-`.ai-pm`/`doc/features` + deny-`**` rules.
- **`question`** — surface PM decision-forks via the structured-question tool.
  This grant is given to the **primary only**: `.opencode/opencode.json` carries a
  top-level `permission: { question: "allow" }`, which the OpenCode loader resolves
  to a `question: allow` rule on the primary (<https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/>).
  The **`pm-*` subagents keep `question: deny`** — each subagent's frontmatter
  re-denies `question` so the top-level allow does **not** cascade onto it
  (last-match-wins). A subagent **returns findings to the orchestrator**; it never
  prompts the PM directly. Verified on OpenCode 1.16.2: the primary resolves
  `question` to `allow`, every `pm-*` subagent resolves it to `deny`.
- **`task`** — spawn the `pm-*` subagents (the protocol roles) and the
  review/research engines. Granted in `ai-pm`'s `tools` map.
- **`skill`** — run protocol skills. Granted in `ai-pm`'s `tools` map.

**Running the orchestrator.** `ai-pm` is wired as the **default primary** via the
top-level `default_agent: "ai-pm"` key in `.opencode/opencode.json`
(<https://opencode.ai/docs/config/>), so a plain `opencode` (or
`opencode run …`) in a downstream starts the orchestrator, **not** `build`. (To
reach a built-in primary deliberately, `opencode run --agent build …`.) Verified
on OpenCode 1.16.2: `opencode agent list` shows `ai-pm (primary)`, and the loader
accepts the config (`opencode debug config --pure`, exit 0).

The `pm-*` agents are **subagents**: the orchestrator spawns them with `task`, they
do their scoped work (read, write their artifact, run tests) and return findings.
They do not surface forks to the PM themselves — that is the orchestrator's seat.

## Review + research engines — OpenCode ships its own (no built-ins)

On Claude the protocol delegates technical-quality review to the **built-in
`code-review` engine** and deep research to the **built-in `deep-research`
engine**. **OpenCode has no built-in equivalents** (verified on 1.16.2: the
built-in agents are only `build` / `plan` / `general` / `explore` — no review or
research engine). So this adapter **ships its own** review and research
subagents, and the orchestrator delegates to them via the `task` tool:

- **`code-review`** (`.opencode/agent/code-review.md`) — reviews the current git
  diff for correctness bugs and reuse/simplification/efficiency cleanups, and
  returns a concise `file:line` findings list. This is what the protocol's review
  step (`WORKFLOW.md` Step 5, Pass 2) delegates to on OpenCode in place of the
  Claude built-in.
- **`deep-research`** (`.opencode/agent/deep-research.md`) — does multi-source
  web research and returns a cited synthesis. This is the OpenCode binding for any
  protocol delegation to the `deep-research` engine.

These are **OpenCode-only**: Claude keeps its built-ins, so the two files are
**not** added to the Claude adapter and are not shared neutral bodies. Their
agent ids stay `code-review` and `deep-research` (matching the protocol's
delegation points), and they are **allowed engines** — the enforcement plugin's
`wb-*` role deny-list does **not** include them (the same way `code-review` /
`deep-research` are not gated on Claude).

> **PREVIEW honesty.** These are solid **single-agent** engines — they are **not**
> a replica of Claude's **multi-agent** `code-review` / `deep-research`.
> `code-review` **does** run cross-model (it is pinned to the control model — see
> the cross-model section below); `deep-research` runs on the **same model as the
> session** (it is not a control agent). Treat them as capable engines, not as a
> drop-in equal of the Claude built-ins.

## Cross-model review — static frontmatter pins (PROVISIONAL preview default)

The protocol's cross-model rule (a control/review layer that runs a **different
model** than the session, for an independent blind-spot check) is realized on
OpenCode by **static model pins in agent frontmatter**. OpenCode has **no runtime
per-`task` model override** — the implementing PR
[anomalyco/opencode#17577](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/17577) is
**closed, not merged** — so the protocol's cross-model rule **degrades to these
static pins** on OpenCode.

- **Session / primary + producer subagents → `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`.** The
  session model is set as the top-level `model` in `.opencode/opencode.json`. The
  **producer** subagents (`pm-architect`, `pm-coder`, `pm-codebase-reader`,
  `pm-stack-researcher`, `pm-pr-prep`, `deep-research`) carry **no `model:` pin**
  — they **inherit** the session model.
- **Control / review subagents → pinned `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`.** The
  review/audit layer — `code-review`, `pm-plan-checker`, `pm-auditor`,
  `pm-product-advocate` — carries an explicit `model:` pin in its generated
  frontmatter, so it runs a **different model than the session**: an independent
  cross-model check that does not share the session model's blind spots.

The same control/review agents also run at **low reasoning effort**
(`variant: minimal`, injected into their frontmatter from `models.control_variant`
in the same single source) — a per-operation effort tier that trims reasoning-token
**count** on these routine/check operations. The **producers** + the orchestrator
(`ai-pm`) carry **no `variant`**: planning, architecture, coding, and orchestration
keep their full default reasoning. Model is the **cost** lever; variant is the
reasoning-**count** lever — two orthogonal dials on the same `models` block.

> **PROVISIONAL preview default — change it for your provider.** DeepSeek is the
> **only authenticated provider** in this preview environment, so
> `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` (session) / `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` (control)
> is a **preview default, not a recommendation**. The choice is **single-sourced**
> in the `models` block of `src/manifests/opencode/adapter.json` (two values +
> the control-agent list); change those and regenerate — the model id is **never**
> hand-edited into individual agent files. When/if a runtime per-`task` model
> override (#17577-class) lands upstream, the adapter can adopt it and retire the
> static pins.

## Supported harnesses

This protocol explicitly supports the following harnesses. The supported set is
declared here — it is **not** to be inferred from which adapter folder happens
to be present:

- **Claude Code** — fully supported (the self-host harness).
- **OpenCode** — **preview** (this adapter; not yet enforcement-certified —
  see the preview label above and the upstream gaps below).

## Named upstream gaps (why OpenCode is preview, not certified)

The OpenCode adapter tracks two named upstream gaps. One still blocks
certification; the other was **verified in our favor on 1.16.2** (so the CORE
enforcement plugin now ships), with a version-pinned caveat:

1. **Runtime per-task model override is unavailable (still a gap; worked
   around with static pins).** OpenCode's `task` tool has no per-invocation
   `model` parameter. The implementing PR
   **[anomalyco/opencode#17577](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/17577)**
   ("add model override for task tool subagents") is **CLOSED, NOT MERGED**.
   Consequence: the protocol's cross-model review/audit mechanism cannot rely
   on a runtime model override on OpenCode — so the reviewer/auditor model is
   pinned **statically in agent frontmatter** instead (see the cross-model
   section above). This is a working degradation, not a blocker: cross-model
   review **is** wired in this preview via the static pins.

2. **Subagent tool-hook containment — VERIFIED in our favor on 1.16.2
   (version-pinned).** Whether a plugin's `tool.execute.before` hook reliably
   constrains a `task`-spawned subagent's tool calls was disputed upstream —
   issue
   **[anomalyco/opencode#5894](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/5894)**
   ("Plugin hooks don't intercept subagent tool calls — security policy
   bypass") is **CLOSED as DISPUTED**, not by a merged fix. **Spike B
   (2026-06-07) verified, on OpenCode 1.16.2, that the hook DOES fire for and
   deny a `task`-spawned subagent's tool call** — so the CORE enforcement plugin
   is **subagent-effective** here, and it **is** shipped in this preview.
   **Version-pinned caveat:** verified on **1.16.2** only; #5894 is historically
   version-sensitive, so **re-verify on every upgrade**. If a future version
   regresses, the plugin's subagent containment must be re-treated as
   best-effort until re-verified.

## Enforcement divergence — the "ask"-class guards are not ported

The Claude Code adapter's `settings.json` carries some guards whose decision is
**"ask"** (prompt the human to confirm) rather than a hard deny: force-push
(`git push --force`), `git commit --no-verify` / `--no-gpg-sign`, ssh + remote
content-edit, and ssh + remote mutating action. **OpenCode's
`tool.execute.before` hook can only throw (hard deny) or allow — it has no "ask"
return** — so these guards have **no faithful equivalent in this plugin** and are
**intentionally not ported**. Forcing them into hard throws would be wrong
(it would block legitimate, PM-confirmed actions). They map instead to OpenCode's
**permission** configuration (<https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/>), a later
slice. Until then, the "ask"-class guards are a **documented divergence**: the
OpenCode adapter enforces the **same clear-DENY guards as the Claude adapter**
(role-duplicator spawn/skill deny, read-outside-root, destructive truncating
write, and the `find`-outside-root boundary deny) but **not** the "ask"-class
ones. The clear-DENY set is now at **parity**; only the "ask"-class guards
remain a divergence (a permission-config follow-up). Do not read the CORE plugin
as full parity with the Claude `settings.json` **for the "ask"-class guards**.

## What this adapter ships (preview scope)

- The `pm-*` **subagents** under `.opencode/agent/` (built from the neutral
  bodies; OpenCode frontmatter shape per
  <https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/>).
- The `/pm-*` **commands** under `.opencode/command/` (the neutral command
  bodies).
- The always-on core wiring via the `instructions` array in
  `.opencode/opencode.json` (the OpenCode analogue of the Claude `@`-import;
  <https://opencode.ai/docs/config/>).
- The **CORE enforcement plugin** `.opencode/plugin/ai-pm-enforcement.js`
  (`tool.execute.before` throws to deny — <https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/>),
  which **auto-loads** from `.opencode/plugin/` (no `opencode.json` registration
  needed — and an explicit `plugin` entry would double-register it, so it is
  deliberately absent). Its wb-* role deny-list is **single-sourced** from the
  Claude `settings.json` (one authored copy, no drift). It enforces the **same
  clear-DENY guards as the Claude adapter** — role-duplicator (`task`/`skill`),
  read-outside-root, truncating write, and the `find`-outside-root boundary —
  only the "ask"-class guards remain not-yet-ported (see the divergence above).

The cross-model **model pins** are shipped as a **PROVISIONAL preview default**
(session `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`, control `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`),
single-sourced in `adapter.json`'s `models` block — see the cross-model section
above. They statically realize the protocol's cross-model rule because OpenCode
has no runtime per-task model override (#17577).
