## Test methodology

The **test-methodology** module is on, so the floor's **Tests** item is deepened from
"added, not weakened" to coverage judgement: where the change touches a layer unit
tests cannot reach, or a user-visible surface, confirm the plan's named coverage
actually exists in the diff — same cite-or-it-didn't-happen rule as the floor.
`[persona]`: this sharpens judgement, denies nothing.

- `[light]` **Coverage named and real** — the plan named how each unit-unreachable layer is covered (or named the untested-layer risk), and the diff carries that coverage; a named test that does not exist is an honesty finding.
- `[rich]` **UI claim backed** — a UI-bearing change names its UI exercise (for web, the real-browser run) and the evidence exists; a UI claim without the named exercise is a finding.
