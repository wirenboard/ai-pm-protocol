# Product contracts

> One file, every product promise this project makes — one short block per user-facing feature. The Operator reads it to see what the product guarantees; the Reviewer checks every change against it. A backend-only change (refactor, infra) adds no block; it touches one only if it changes visible behaviour.
>
> Plain product language only — what the user can do, not how it is wired. A machine grammar (id formats, enums, value ranges, topic conventions) lives once in `architecture.md`; reference it here, never restate it. A promised number the Operator hasn't fixed yet is `[?]` — never invent one.

<!-- One block per feature. Copy the shape below; delete this comment and the example. -->

## <feature name>

**Value** — <one plain sentence: what the user gets and why it exists>.
**Who** — <the specific user or role, not "the user">.

**Must work**
- <a concrete thing the user can do or expect>

**Must not break** — invariants that stay true across future changes
- <something that must remain true>
- <a user-facing limit the product promises (max items, perceived speed) — `[?]` if unfixed>

**Verified by** — <test name or command the Reviewer runs on every change touching this feature>.
**Last reviewed** — <YYYY-MM-DD>, against <commit / "current main">.
