// 1. Vendor the shared adapter AND the neutral bodies the assembler reads, into the
// target's tooling location. The vendored install-*.mjs self-locate their ROOT as
// .ai-dev/tooling/ (three dirs up from the script), and read src/agents, src/modules,
// src/adapter from there — so all three must sit under .ai-dev/tooling/src/.
// Also vendored: everything the vendored installer ITSELF reads on the upgrade
// re-run (PROTOCOL.md, src/quality/, src/templates/ — layDownCore's sources) plus
// its own VERSION (resolveSourceVersion's vendored branch + the audit's skew check)
// — without these the documented upgrade command ENOENTs.

// 2. Lay down the core the downstream loads + the quality-layer shape.

// trigger fires (e.g. parallel-work) via the stable path .ai-dev/procedures/<x>.md —
// the SAME path in dogfood and downstream. vendorTooling also copies them under
// .ai-dev/tooling/src/agents/procedures/ (for the upgrade re-run), but that subtree is
// read-denied unconditionally (invariant 2), so the AGENT cannot read them there; this
// readable copy is the one the trigger resolves to. Source of truth stays
// src/agents/procedures/ (one home); this is the deployed copy, committed + drift-guarded
// (install-drift.test.mjs), like the assembled .opencode/.claude artifacts. Runs in BOTH
// modes — in dogfood SOURCE===target so it converges to the committed bytes (git clean).

// 2c. Deploy the RUNTIME-READ module files (src/modules/**) to a READABLE, non-tooling
// home: .ai-dev/modules/. PREDICATE — a src/modules file gets a readable deploy iff a
// RUNTIME role reads it on-demand: it is referenced BY PATH from a runtime instruction (a
// deployed procedure body or a composed agent fragment) and resolved when a trigger fires.
// It does NOT get a deploy if it is ASSEMBLY-ONLY — consumed by the installer at assembly
// time and baked into an artifact the runtime role reads instead: registry.json (the
// assembler reads it) and every <id>/<role>.md FRAGMENT (composed into the role agents;
// the runtime role reads the assembled agent, never the fragment file). Today the ONLY
// runtime-read file is elicitation/catalog.md — referenced from elicitation.md /
// product-discovery.md (deployed procedures) and elicitation/builder.md (composed builder
// fragment), NONE of which any assembler composes. Like deployProcedures, the source of
// truth stays src/modules/ (one home); this readable copy is what the runtime reference
// (.ai-dev/modules/<rel>) resolves to in BOTH dogfood and downstream, since the vendored
// .ai-dev/tooling/src/modules/ copy is read-denied unconditionally (invariant 2). Committed
// + drift-guarded (install-drift.test.mjs). Runs in BOTH modes — in dogfood SOURCE===target
// so it converges to the committed bytes (git clean). Adding a runtime-read file = one line
// here + a repoint; over-deploying the whole tree would duplicate every assembly-only
// fragment into a second readable home (an invariant-6 smell), so we deploy the allow-list only.

// 3. Ensure a config exists so the agent assembly has its `roles` bindings. A real
// project configures via /dev-setup; pre-setup we write a minimal default carrying
// the resolved platform + the standard seat ids. Written ONLY where absent — a
// re-run never overwrites the Operator's configured file. Config lives inside
// .ai-dev/ — not at the project root.
// Returns TRUE when it actually wrote the default, FALSE when an existing config was
// kept — so the install summary reports the truth instead of an unconditional
// "wrote config" that scares a re-installing Operator into thinking their pins were
// clobbered (docs/decisions/multi-model-setup-ux.md papercut 9).

// crash before its delete, or a blind `git add -A`, must not commit it), and

// `claude` run from the project root, framed optional but generated ALWAYS (so enabling
// routing or a configDir later needs no re-install; docs/decisions/launcher-ux.md).
//
//   Claude   → wraps the router-launch engine: `exec node <engine> "$@"`. The engine
//              decides direct-vs-router and layers the launch env (configDir included),
//              so a plain single-model project just launches claude through it.

//              launch is an HONEST stub: it prints the Claude-only note and execs
//              `opencode "$@"` (no proxy).
//
// Layout-aware engine path: dogfood wires to src/adapter/, downstream to the vendored
// .ai-dev/tooling/src/adapter/ — the SAME split every wiring step uses. The committed
// dogfood form is the single home the drift guard locks (install-drift.test.mjs).
//
// Security (semgrep / shell-exec surface): the script is a fixed template — the only
// interpolated value is the engine path, a literal the installer controls (never user
// input). It uses `exec ... "$@"` (argv passthrough, no `sh -c "$untrusted"`), so no
// argument is ever re-parsed by a shell. The file is written 0755.
