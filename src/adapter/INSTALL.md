# Installing the adapter into a downstream project

The single home for **where each file lands and how each platform is wired**. The adapter is one shared core (`engine.mjs`, `deny-rules.json`, `tool-map.json`) plus the two platform shims; install ships the whole `src/adapter/` tree to one place the project can reach, then wires the active platform to its shim.

## The one command

```sh
node src/adapter/install.mjs <target-dir> [--platform claude|opencode]
```

`install.mjs` does the **whole** procedure below in one idempotent pass — vendor the adapter, lay down the core + doc templates, wire the active platform — so a downstream is adopted by one command, not a hand-followed checklist. It:

- **vendors** the shared adapter, the neutral bodies the assembler reads (`src/agents/`, `src/modules/`), and everything the vendored installer itself reads on an upgrade re-run (`PROTOCOL.md`, `src/quality/`, `src/templates/`, its own `VERSION`) into `<target>/.ai-dev/tooling/` (the convention below) — so the vendored installer is self-sufficient;
- **lays down** the core (`.ai-dev/PROTOCOL.md`, the quality-runner shape at `.ai-dev/quality/`, the per-version migration notes at `.ai-dev/upgrades.md`) into the target's `.ai-dev/` directory. Doc templates are NOT copied to the target root — they live in `.ai-dev/tooling/src/templates/` and are laid down on demand when product discovery / doc bootstrap run;
- **wires** the active platform by running its assembly scripts (the `## Claude Code` / `## OpenCode` sections) against the target and merging its load-instruction surface (the `CLAUDE.md` import + `.claude/settings.json` hooks for Claude; `opencode.json` + `AGENTS.md` + the generated plugin for OpenCode), de-duped so a re-run never duplicates a hook or an import — a stale ai-dev hook group whose command changed is *replaced* (recognised by the shim's path tail), never accumulated;
- writes a minimal **breadcrumb load-surface for the INACTIVE platform** (a marker-delimited block in its `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) — a session opened on the unwired platform learns the protocol exists and what to run; merged in without clobbering a real file, replaced by the full wiring when that platform becomes active;
- **stamps `.ai-dev/VERSION`** on every run and, on a detected version change, writes the transient `.ai-dev/UPGRADING.md` marker + prints a restart notice (the upgrade channel's mechanical half — `docs/decisions/upgrade-migration.md`; the session half is `src/agents/procedures/upgrade.md`);
- **prints the exact version it is installing, loudly and first** (`→ Installing ai-dev-protocol vX.Y.Z`, before the per-step lines) so a stale-cache no-op is visible at a glance — and, on a same-version re-run whose source path looks npx-fetched (an `_npx` segment), adds a one-line caveat pointing at the cache-clear recipe. **Heuristic, not detection:** the installer runs FROM the (possibly stale) source, so it cannot KNOW the cache is stale — it makes the version loud so you can judge; a git-clone run never trips the caveat (no false alarm);
- **installs a local pre-push quality gate** (default-ON, downstream only) at `<target>/.git/hooks/pre-push` — it runs the quality registry runner WHOLESALE (`node .ai-dev/quality/run.mjs build`) and blocks a push of build-beat-failing code before it leaves the machine. **Never-clobbers** a project's own pre-push hook (a non-ai-dev hook is left untouched with a one-line warning naming the line to add); idempotent (our own marker hook refreshes to identical bytes). **Honest limits:** `git push --no-verify` bypasses it; it is local-only (a fresh clone has no hooks until re-install) and runs the **build** beat only. It is the LOCAL fast layer — the [merge-gate](../../PROTOCOL.md) and remote CI are the other two layers; remove the hook file to opt out;
- writes a minimal default `.ai-dev/config.json` where absent (a real project then runs `/dev-setup`), and prints a summary + the next step.
- **warns when the target has no git repository** (the loop — branches, reviews, the merge-gate — runs on git). A warning, never a block or an auto-`git init`: the interactive init offer is setup's repo check (`src/agents/orchestrator.md` `## Setup` step 0, the single home).

Platform resolution: the `--platform` flag, else the target's `.ai-dev/config.json` `platform`, else a clear error — never a silent guess. The guarantee it realises is `docs/contracts/one-command-install.md`; the test is `src/adapter/install.test.mjs`.

### Dogfood / source mode (`--dogfood`)

```sh
node src/adapter/install.mjs . --dogfood --platform claude     # or --platform opencode
```

The protocol's own repo develops itself under its own protocol, so it must wire to its **own `src/` tree**, not to a vendored copy of itself. `--dogfood` is that self-host mode — use it **only** when installing into the protocol's own source repo. It:

- wires the three tracked surfaces to the source tree — the Claude hook → `src/adapter/claude/shim.mjs`; `CLAUDE.md` imports → `@PROTOCOL.md` + `@.claude/ai-dev.md` (the assembled, platform-filtered orchestrator surface — same path downstream); OpenCode `opencode.json` `instructions` → `PROTOCOL.md` and the plugin → `src/adapter` (the existing dev-layout auto-detection);
- **skips** vendoring `.ai-dev/tooling/` (the repo already carries its core at the root — a copy would be untracked debris) and **skips** the `.ai-dev/VERSION` stamp + `UPGRADING.md` marker (the repo's authoritative version is its own `package.json`, read live);
- writes no inactive-platform breadcrumb (both load surfaces are real, hand-authored, committed files).

The guarantee: **a reinstall here converges to the committed bytes** — `git status --porcelain` is empty after a dogfood reinstall on either platform.

Fail-closed and **symmetric** (the footgun made loud): `--dogfood` against a non-source target is a hard error (the wired `src/...` paths would dangle), and its **absence** when the target IS the source repo is equally a hard error (a downstream-mode install there would churn the tracked source-mode files). Neither direction proceeds silently.

The rest of this file is the **underlying detail** — what each wiring step does, the single home for each. The installer automates exactly these; reach for a manual step only to understand or to wire one platform by hand.

Convention used below: the adapter ships inside the protocol's tooling submodule at `.ai-dev/tooling/src/adapter/`. A project that vendors the adapter elsewhere rewrites the one path in each wiring step — nothing else changes.

## Upgrade

A downstream upgrades by bumping the protocol source and re-running the same one command:

1. Bump the protocol to the new version — re-fetch the release (`npx github:wirenboard/ai-pm-protocol <target>`), or bump the tooling submodule and re-run the **vendored** installer (`node .ai-dev/tooling/src/adapter/install.mjs . --platform <platform>` — the vendored tree is self-sufficient for this). **Clear the npx cache first** (`rm -rf "$(npm config get cache)/_npx"`) when re-fetching via `npx` — npx caches the GitHub checkout and otherwise silently re-installs the stale version; the cache-proof alternative is a fresh `git clone` + `node src/adapter/install.mjs` (README `## Updating an existing install` carries the operator quick-recipe). The installer now **prints the version it is installing loudly and first**, and on a same-version re-run that looks npx-fetched it **warns the cache may be stale** with the clear-recipe — a heuristic prompt so a stale no-op is visible, not a guarantee (it runs from the possibly-stale source and cannot KNOW).
2. The re-run IS the upgrade — its idempotence and never-clobber guarantees mean the project's `.ai-dev/config.json` and real docs survive. It stamps `.ai-dev/VERSION`, refreshes `.ai-dev/upgrades.md`, and on a detected version change writes the `.ai-dev/UPGRADING.md` marker and asks for a session restart; the next session offers the migration check (`src/agents/procedures/upgrade.md`).
3. Read the CHANGELOG between the two versions (shipped in the package). The per-version migration steps — what a MAJOR bump renames, what survives, why downgrades are unsupported — live in **`upgrades.md`** (this directory; laid down at `.ai-dev/upgrades.md`), the single home. MINOR/PATCH versions without a section there need nothing beyond the re-run.

## Claude Code

Merge this into the project's `.claude/settings.json` (the fragment lives at `claude/hooks.json`). One `PreToolUse` hook and one `UserPromptSubmit` hook, both piping the harness payload to `node claude/shim.mjs`; the shim self-locates `deny-rules.json` (two dirs up) and prints the verdict JSON.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Read|Write|Edit|Bash|Task|Skill",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.ai-dev/tooling/src/adapter/claude/shim.mjs\"" }] }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.ai-dev/tooling/src/adapter/claude/shim.mjs\"" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

Every guard reads the one shared engine.

After writing `settings.json`, the installer **self-verifies the Claude deny wiring** and **fails the install loudly** (non-zero exit, naming the cause) if it is broken — the symmetric twin of the OpenCode plugin self-verify (`## OpenCode` → *Enforce deny*). It checks that `settings.json` parses AND carries a `PreToolUse` hook referencing the deny shim, AND that the shim itself loads (a `node --check` syntax probe plus a child `import()` that exercises its `engine.mjs` / `deny-rules.json` import chain). So a malformed `settings.json`, a dropped hook entry, or a shim that cannot load can no longer ship a silently-disabled deny path under a printed success. **Honest boundary: this is a LOAD/SHAPE check, not a runtime-fires check** — it proves the shim is syntactically loadable and the hook entry is present, NOT that Claude Code actually invokes the hook at each tool call (that residual matches the OpenCode plugin's, covered by the audit-cadence real-layer probe).

### Load instructions (the orchestrator session)

`CLAUDE.md` imports the constitution and the orchestrator's procedure — that is all the running session loads as the protocol (plus the project's own kind + language lines):

```text
@.ai-dev/PROTOCOL.md
@.claude/ai-dev.md
```

The orchestrator **is** the session, so it is NOT a spawnable subagent (Claude auto-registers those from `.claude/agents/`). Its procedure is loaded via `@.claude/ai-dev.md` — a committed, drift-guarded artifact the install-agents step assembles by running the **same** `composeBody` platform filter the spawnable agents get (dropping the inactive OpenCode caveats), written outside `.claude/agents/` so it is never registered as a spawnable. The same `@.claude/ai-dev.md` path is wired in both dogfood and downstream modes. The Builder and Reviewer are spawned (below).

### Spawn a sub-agent (the Builder and Reviewer)

**`node src/adapter/claude/install-agents.mjs`** assembles the two spawnable roles into Claude agent files:

- It reads each neutral role body (`src/agents/<role>.md`) + the Claude frontmatter (`src/adapter/claude/agents/<role>.fm`) and writes `.claude/agents/<agentId>.md`.
- The **agent id comes from `.ai-dev/config.json` `roles`** (so `builder` → `dev-builder`, `reviewer` → `dev-reviewer`).
- It is concatenation, not a generator — the neutral body stays the single source.
- Re-run it whenever a role body, its frontmatter, or the config binding changes.

The orchestrator spawns each by that id, on the model `.ai-dev/config.json` resolves.

### Command (the explicit setup trigger)

**`node src/adapter/claude/install-commands.mjs`** assembles the `/dev-setup` slash-command into **`.claude/commands/dev-setup.md`** — the neutral command body (`src/adapter/commands/dev-setup.body.md`) + the Claude frontmatter (`src/adapter/claude/commands/dev-setup.fm`).

- The filename without extension is the command (`dev-setup.md` → `/dev-setup`).
- The body becomes the prompt injected into the session; the orchestrator **is** the session, so it runs its own `## Setup`.
- The body is a thin pointer — no copy of the dialog (single home, invariant 6).
- Re-run it whenever the neutral body or the frontmatter changes.

**Apply config** — the shared re-assemble-after-setup step is homed in `tool-map.json` `apply-config` + `docs/architecture.md`. Claude delta: the reviewer model is resolved at *spawn*, not baked, so applying is just **`node src/adapter/claude/install-agents.mjs`** refreshing the assembled bodies (re-run `install-commands.mjs` too if the command surface changed).

## OpenCode

**OpenCode loads agents from `.opencode/agents/` — PLURAL** (the singular `.opencode/agent/` is **not** loaded). A **plugin** is deployed to `.opencode/plugins/` but, as of OpenCode **1.17.8**, is loaded ONLY when registered in the `plugin` key of `opencode.json` — project-folder plugin auto-discovery was dropped in that release. The deploy dir is where the file lands; the `plugin` key is what makes OpenCode load it (see *Enforce deny* below).

### Enforce deny (the plugin)

**`node src/adapter/opencode/install-plugin.mjs`** generates the deployed plugin — `.opencode/plugins/ai-dev.mjs` — FROM the source entry `src/adapter/opencode/plugin-entry.mjs`. It retargets only the adapter location to where the target vendors it (downstream: `.ai-dev/tooling/src/adapter`, no rewrite; dev/this repo: `src/adapter`).

- It must **define** each hook function inline — a hook imported from another module and re-exported under the entry's own name is NOT registered by the loader (it loads but its hook never fires).
- So the thin wrappers are **inline in the entry**; only the rule logic (`decide`/`decidePrompt` + the engine) is imported from the adapter tree, which sits outside the scanned plugin dir. The rules stay single-sourced.
- The deployed file is **generated, not hand-copied** — so it cannot drift from the source (`src/adapter/install-plugin.test.mjs` guards byte-identity).
- After writing, the installer **import-verifies the deployed plugin actually loads** from its installed layout and **fails the install loudly** (non-zero exit, naming the plugin path + the load error + the "enforcement would be silently off" hint) if it does not — so a wrong-depth rewrite, an un-vendored adapter, or a stale cached layout can no longer ship a silently-disabled floor under a printed success. **Honest boundary: this is a LOAD check, not a registration check** — it proves the module imports, not that OpenCode invokes the hook at runtime (that is the `plugin`-key registration below).
- Re-run it whenever the entry changes.
- **Registration is REQUIRED** (OpenCode 1.17.8 dropped project-folder plugin auto-discovery): the deployed plugin loads only when listed in the `plugin` key of `opencode.json`. The installer adds `"./plugins/ai-dev.mjs"` to that key (de-duped, never clobbering a project's own entries). The spec is **`.opencode/`-relative**, not project-root-relative — OpenCode resolves a relative plugin path against the dir of `opencode.json` (i.e. `.opencode/`), so `./plugins/ai-dev.mjs` is correct and `./.opencode/plugins/...` double-resolves and silently fails to load. Without this key the boundary deny never fires — the whole `[mechanical]` floor is absent.

The entry registers **one** hook — the only enforcement class OpenCode realises mechanically:

- **`tool.execute.before`** (deny) — resolve root, resolve the actor, call `decide`, **throw** on a deny verdict (the throw is OpenCode's block).

**`inject` is persona-only on OpenCode** — there is no `chat.message` hook. The former realisation (push `{ type: "text", text: reason }` onto `output.parts`, the analog of Claude's `UserPromptSubmit`) **crashed the host on opencode 1.17.8**: pushing a part made `SessionPrompt.createUserMessage` throw `EventV2.InvalidSyncEvent: Expected string aggregate field sessionID` *after* the hook returned (uncatchable in-hook), crashing the session on every change-verb message; injected parts were also unreliably rendered upstream. So the inject-class rules (`no-config-run-setup`, `no-product-brief-discover`, `change-route-reminder`) fall back to persona on OpenCode — the orchestrator's own loaded prose carries the loop / change-routing / setup-first discipline regardless. Recorded per-rule in `deny-rules.json` `fallback`; ground-truthed live on opencode 1.17.8 (2026-06-19). Do not re-add a `chat.message` push without a confirmed-stable opencode hook (a supported `experimental.chat.system.transform` / `chat.params` migration is a backlog candidate, deferred because `experimental.*` is version-brittle).

`ask` likewise has no plugin-hook realisation on OpenCode, so an `ask`-class rule also falls back to persona (recorded per-rule in `deny-rules.json` `fallback`). The plugin supplies only the deny mechanism — the verb list and predicates stay in `deny-rules.json` + the engine.

### Load instructions + the orchestrator personality

UNLIKE Claude (where the orchestrator IS the session, held by `CLAUDE.md`), an OpenCode session runs as a **primary agent** — so the orchestrator is its own primary agent: `default_agent` points at it, and the shared constitution loads via `instructions`:

```json
{
  "default_agent": "ai-dev",
  "instructions": [".ai-dev/PROTOCOL.md"],
  "permission": { "edit": "allow", "bash": "allow", "webfetch": "allow", "question": "allow" },
  "agent": { "build": { "disable": true }, "plan": { "disable": true } },
  "plugin": ["./plugins/ai-dev.mjs"]
}
```

The permission block sets native OpenCode permissions to full-speed inside the project. Division of labor: the **protocol plugin is the sole boundary guard** (mechanically denies reads/writes/finds outside the project root); native `permission` is the speed dial for tool calls inside that boundary. Honest residual: `bash` boundary is best-effort (the engine parses obvious path tokens; an opaque escape like `python3 -c '...'` is not mechanically caught). `edit`/`read`/`write` tool-call checks are exact. `webfetch: allow` because research needs outbound fetches; sending project data out is a separate `[persona]` rule, not a filesystem-boundary concern.

The generic `build`/`plan` primaries are disabled so none can fill the orchestrator seat (invariant 1); `AGENTS.md` (repo root) is OpenCode's always-on surface and points at the same constitution.

### Spawn a sub-agent (and assemble the orchestrator)

`node src/adapter/opencode/install-agents.mjs` assembles the three role agents into `.opencode/agents/`: each neutral role body (`src/agents/<role>.md`) + its OpenCode frontmatter (`src/adapter/opencode/agents/<role>.fm`) → `.opencode/agents/<agentId>.md`.

- The agent id comes from `.ai-dev/config.json` `roles`: orchestrator → `ai-dev` with `mode: primary`; builder → `dev-builder`, reviewer → `dev-reviewer` with `mode: subagent`.
- On OpenCode the filename *is* the agent id, so the frontmatter carries no `name` key.
- Concatenation, not a generator — the neutral body stays the single source, shared with the Claude adapter.
- Re-run it whenever a role body, its frontmatter, or the config binding changes.

The session runs as `ai-dev` (the personality loads) and a write into `.ai-dev/tooling/` is mechanically blocked by the plugin (the engine's self-patch deny).

### Command (the explicit setup trigger)

**`node src/adapter/opencode/install-commands.mjs`** assembles the `/dev-setup` command into **`.opencode/commands/dev-setup.md`** (the plural `commands/` dir, matching `.opencode/agents/` and `.opencode/plugins/`; the singular `.opencode/command/` is NOT loaded).

- The command body (`src/adapter/commands/dev-setup.body.md`, shared with Claude) is the prompt template.
- The frontmatter (`src/adapter/opencode/commands/dev-setup.fm`) carries `description` + **`agent: ai-dev`** so the command targets the orchestrator primary, which runs its own `## Setup`.
- It is a thin pointer — no copy of the dialog (single home, invariant 6).
- Re-run it whenever the neutral body or the frontmatter changes.

**Apply config** — the shared re-assemble-after-setup step is homed in `tool-map.json` `apply-config` + `docs/architecture.md`. OpenCode delta: **`node src/adapter/opencode/install-agents.mjs`** assembles the role agents but bakes **no** reviewer `model:` line — the OpenCode `task` runtime ignores a subagent's `model:`, so no cross-model reviewer is realisable here (why: `tool-map.json` `models.opencode._note`). Re-run `install-commands.mjs` too if the command surface changed.

> **Fallback (no dir guess needed):** if a future opencode stops loading the markdown command dir, define the command inline in `opencode.json` under the `command` key. The SDK `Config.command` schema (`{ template, description, agent, model, subtask }`, confirmed in `@opencode-ai/sdk`) takes the same body as `template` and `agent: ai-dev`. The markdown-dir form is preferred here because it shares the one neutral body file with Claude.
