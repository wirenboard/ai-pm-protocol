> **This file is the canonical orchestration spec** — read by agents and downstream `CLAUDE.md` via `@.ai-pm/tooling/WORKFLOW.md`. For a friendlier overview of the protocol (Russian, marketing-level) see `README.md`. When the two documents disagree, this one wins.

## Workflow agents and commands

### Agents (`.claude/agents/`)

Spawned by the orchestrator — do not run manually. Use only these — do not substitute with similarly-named agents from other toolsets (a `PreToolUse` guard in `.claude/settings.json` denies the known `wb-*` role duplicators automatically — see **Hook-level enforcement** below):

| Agent | When |
|---|---|
| `pm-stack-researcher` | Auto-spawn from `/pm-bootstrap` (initial stack onboarding) or from `/pm-plan` (when a feature touches a stack component not yet in `docs/stack-notes.md`). Reads canonical docs + spec, writes cited rules into stack-notes |
| `pm-architect` | Structural choice in the plan — where does new code live? Plus: owns canonical `docs/architecture.md` (creates at bootstrap, refreshes on audit findings, updates on architectural decisions, fills doc gaps spawned from `/pm-plan`). |
| `pm-coder` | Implement the plan |
| `pm-plan-checker` | Plan compliance after implementation — verifies all scenarios implemented, contracts honored, interaction scenarios tested, DoD satisfied |
| `pm-pr-prep` | Bump version, generate CHANGELOG, push branch, open or update PR |
| `pm-legacy-reader` | Auto-spawn from `/pm-bootstrap` legacy full mode; reads existing codebase and writes `docs/architecture.md` + `docs/user-journeys.md`. Also spawned standalone when `docs/user-journeys.md` has gaps. |
| `pm-auditor` | Auto-spawn from `/pm-audit`; protocol compliance sweep — checks artifact completeness, plan↔implementation parity, contract currency, docs currency. Writes `.ai-pm/audits/audit-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` and returns a structured summary. Does NOT review technical code quality — that is pm-plan-checker + code-review per feature. |

### Commands (`.claude/commands/`)

Run in the main orchestrator session:

| Command | When |
|---|---|
| `/pm-bootstrap` | Initialize a new or legacy project — create docs structure, spawn pm-stack-researcher and pm-architect. |
| `/pm-plan` | Plan a feature, fix, or non-trivial change. Initializes execution state; handles hotfix mode. |
| `/pm-research` | Research existing solutions and analogues (build vs use). PM-facing pros/cons output. Different from `pm-stack-researcher` (which is agent-facing canonical citations). |
| `/pm-audit` | PM-initiated protocol compliance check. Orchestrator auto-decides scope: full (all features) or diff (since last audit) — based on last audit date and feature count; never asks PM. Spawns `pm-auditor`, drives a PM-facing finding loop (fix now / next sprint / accept-with-context). Full scope offered after `/pm-audit` completes as optional `code-review ultra`. |
| `/pm-fixup` | Fast path for trivial changes (≤ 50 lines, no behavior change, no stack-notes touch, no new code file). Skips `/pm-plan`; goes directly to `pm-coder` + `pm-plan-checker` in trivial mode. Falls back to `/pm-plan` if any condition fails. |

`code-review` (built-in Claude Code skill) — full technical quality sweep: bugs, security, dead code. Use `ultra` level for deep multi-agent review. Runs automatically as Pass 2 in the review loop after every feature; offered as optional deep sweep after `/pm-audit`.

**Project boundary rule (applies to all agents):** every agent must stay within the project root (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`). Never search, read, or write outside it — no parent directories, no sibling repositories. When the orchestrator spawns an agent, include the absolute project root in the prompt if the working directory may be a subdirectory.

**Edit-ownership rule (applies to the orchestrator inside the local repo):** the orchestrator does not edit **content artefacts** directly. Content artefacts are anything that captures the project's design, code, contracts or canon — source code, schemas, manifests, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/user-journeys.md`, `docs/stack-notes.md`, feature plans under `docs/features/`, review artifacts under `.ai-pm/reviews/`, arch notes under `.ai-pm/arch/`, audit reports under `.ai-pm/audits/`. Each of those has an agent that owns it (`pm-coder`, `pm-architect`, `pm-stack-researcher`, `pm-legacy-reader`, `pm-auditor`, `pm-plan-checker`, `pm-plan` as a command). When a content artefact needs to change — even by one line — the orchestrator respawns the responsible agent with a focused prompt, not picks up the editor itself.

**Orchestration artefacts** are different: they are the by-products of the orchestrator's own job of talking to the PM and routing work. `.ai-pm/backlog.md` entries, recording PM decisions, choosing remediation order for audit findings, kicking off git operations (commits, branches, tags, push), and invoking the project's own deployment script — all of these are normal orchestrator work. Spawning a separate "backlog-curator" agent for these would be overhead with no upside.

The line: if it captures product design or technical canon, an agent writes it. If it records the conversation with the PM or moves work through the pipeline, the orchestrator writes it.

**Remote-system boundary rule (applies to all agents and the orchestrator):** the rule is about **the source of truth**, not about whether ssh-with-write is allowed at all. Production code, configs, schemas, manifests and infrastructure files that **the project owns in git** must change through git — never by editing the file in place on a remote system. Everything else (runtime state, deployment actions, dev experiments, PM-initiated maintenance) is fair game.

**Forbidden:**
- Silently editing on a remote system a file that has a counterpart in the repo (a schema in `/usr/share/.../schemas/`, a config template in `/etc/`, code under `/opt/`, a unit file, a Kubernetes manifest). Even if the fix looks tiny and obvious — that path destroys the git source of truth, the next firmware update or container rebuild reverts it, and the next feature will plan against the in-repo state which silently disagrees with reality.
- Restarting / mutating production state without PM's awareness while investigating a "doesn't work in prod" report. The diagnose flow stays read-only until the fix is planned. Once the plan is in motion and the PM has agreed, the deployment script can do whatever it does.

**Allowed:**
- Read-only diagnostics: logs, statuses, file content reads, `journalctl`, `systemctl status`, `docker logs`, native audit / health commands, `tcpdump`, `strace` — anything that observes without changing files the repo owns.
- Mutating actions on dev or staging environments as part of normal development workflow: build, scp a feature-branch artifact, smoke-test on real hardware before opening a PR.
- Mutating actions on production **when the PM has explicitly asked for them in this conversation**: a requested reboot, package upgrade, factory reset, pairing operation. These are product decisions, not silent fixes.
- Operations on runtime state that does not live in the repo: clear caches, restart a service to pick up a new package, rotate logs, manage pairing / fabric credentials, MQTT messages to virtual controls.
- Running the project's own deployment script / playbook / CI step — that is the canonical change channel and is reviewed code already.

The bright line: **if the file you're about to touch on a remote system has a sibling in the repo, the change goes through git first.** Otherwise it's a runtime / deployment action — proceed with the usual product caution (back up before destructive ops, ask PM before anything irreversible).

**Audit-to-fix transition rule.** After `/pm-audit` completes, the orchestrator must not silently load `/pm-plan` and start planning. Two valid paths:
- PM goes through the per-finding loop (step 4 in `pm-audit.md`): one question per finding → explicit "fix now / next sprint / accept-with-context" → then /pm-plan for each "fix now" in order.
- PM gives a blanket "fix it" / "исправь" / "go ahead" after the summary → orchestrator confirms the full list ("I'll fix N findings in order: 1. X, 2. Y, 3. Z. Starting with #1.") and proceeds in priority order.

In both cases the PM sees what will be fixed before the first `/pm-plan` loads. What is forbidden: loading `/pm-plan` without showing PM the finding list — that removes PM from the triage decision entirely.

**Hook-level enforcement.** The rules above are also enforced as Claude Code `PreToolUse` hooks shipped in `.claude/settings.json`, so they hold even if a future session does not re-read this file:

- `ssh ... sed -i / vi / vim / nano / tee / > file` on a remote host — **denied** automatically (direct content edit; this is the silent-fix path the rule is designed to block).
- `ssh ... systemctl restart / docker compose / docker exec / apt / npm install / kubectl apply / rm / cp / mv / mkdir / touch` on a remote host — **asked** for confirmation (legitimate when it is deployment, PM-initiated maintenance, or runtime-state work; the prompt makes that intent explicit).
- `git push --force / -f / --force-with-lease` — **asked** (rewrites remote history).
- `git commit --no-verify / --no-gpg-sign` — **asked** (bypasses pre-commit / signing).
- Spawning a `wb-*` role agent or loading a `wb-*` role skill that occupies a protocol seat (`wb-development:coder` / `code-reviewer` / `design-review` / `pr-prep` / `plan-feature`, `wb-git:workflow` / `pr-author`) — **denied** automatically, with a pointer to the `pm-*` equivalent. This is the mechanical form of the "use only these agents" rule above. It is a **named deny-list, never an "everything but `pm-*`" block**: built-in engines (`code-review`, `deep-research`) and `wb-*` knowledge skills (`codestyle`, `package-bootstrap`, platform skills) are explicitly not gated — the protocol delegates engines and platform knowledge to them on purpose.

On every change-intent prompt a `UserPromptSubmit` hook injects a one-paragraph reminder of this route (Step 0 → `/pm-plan` → coder → review → pr-prep; orchestrator does not edit content artefacts; use `pm-*`, not `wb-*` role skills). It stays silent on ordinary conversation. This is the soft, every-turn counterpart to the hard PreToolUse guard above — it keeps the protocol asserted without depending on a session re-reading this file.

Read-only ssh diagnostics (`cat` for reading, `ls`, `journalctl`, `systemctl status`, `docker logs`, `docker ps`, native status / audit / info commands) are not gated. Local mutating commands (anything not over ssh) are not gated either — they are normal dev work.

Throwaway/diagnostic scripts go in `.claude/tmp/` (inside the project root, so they pass the path-boundary hooks), not `/tmp`. The directory is git-ignored — it is scratch, never committed.

Hooks themselves are tested by `tests/hooks.sh`, gated by `.github/workflows/lint-hooks.yml` on every PR that touches the hooks or their tests. A regex regression now fails CI rather than silently degrading the gate.

**Git workflow — orchestrator owns this, not subagents:**

```
git checkout main && git pull          # always start from current main
git checkout -b feature/<topic>        # fresh branch — one branch per PR
                                       # (may contain one or several features)
... implement, commit ...
pr-prep                                # CHANGELOG + version + push + PR
merge on GitHub                        # GitHub squashes
git checkout main && git pull          # back to main, ready for next branch
```

Never reuse a branch across multiple PRs. Never commit "resolve merge conflicts" — if conflicts appear, the branch is stale; cut a fresh one from main.

## How I work

**If `docs/` doesn't exist yet** — I'll ask you a few questions and set up the project documentation before we do anything else. You don't need to run any commands.

When you describe a feature or bug:

**Step 0 — Check git state.** Before anything else:
- Run `git branch --show-current` and `git status`.
- If on `main` → create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<topic>`.
- If on an existing feature branch → ask the user: "We're on branch `<branch>`. Continue here (add this feature to the same PR) or cut a fresh branch?"
- If working tree is dirty → ask the user to commit or stash first.

**Step 1 — I read the project context first.** `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/user-journeys.md`, `docs/features/`. No questions until I understand what already exists.

**Step 2 — We plan together.** I ask clarifying questions grounded in the architecture and existing scenarios. Then I show you the plan in plain language — scenarios, what changes for users, what must not break — and ask: does this match what you want?

**Step 3 — I show you the architecture decision (if one was needed).** If the plan had a structural question (where does new code live?), I'll explain what was decided and why — in plain language, with a diagram if it helps. You can push back.

**Step 4 — Coder implements.** Works on a feature branch, commits atomically as it goes, runs pipeline, never touches existing tests.

If the plan's **Docs to update** section is non-empty — before starting the review loop, spawn the owning agent with a focused prompt: `pm-architect` for `docs/architecture.md` changes, `pm-legacy-reader` for `docs/user-journeys.md` changes. This satisfies DoD item 8 before pm-plan-checker runs.

After coder (and any doc agents) finish, I tell you:
- What the feature now does (user perspective, no code)
- How to try it yourself step by step
- Anything that needs your attention

**Step 5 — Review loop.** Two sequential passes. You don't see either — they run until both pass, then you hear the result.

**Pass 1 — Plan compliance** (`pm-plan-checker`): are all plan scenarios implemented and tested? contracts honored? interaction scenarios covered? DoD satisfied? Writes `.ai-pm/reviews/<topic>_review.md`.
- Blocking → `pm-coder` fixes → pass 1 re-runs. Repeat until clean.

**Pass 2 — Technical quality** (`code-review`): bugs, security, dead code, simplifications. Only starts after pass 1 is clean.
- Orchestrator runs `code-review`, takes findings from the output, and appends them to `.ai-pm/reviews/<topic>_review.md` as `## Code review findings` — so `pm-coder` has a persistent artifact to read.
- `pm-coder` reads `.ai-pm/reviews/<topic>_review.md`, fixes the code-review findings, commits.
- Orchestrator re-runs `code-review` to verify clean. Repeat until no findings.
- When clean: orchestrator updates the section to `## Code review: <date> — passed`.

Once both passes clear, I surface only what requires a product decision:

- **Product notes** (something that affects what the user sees or changes scope) — I present each one: fix now, add to backlog, or ignore?
- **Nothing to decide** → I go straight to step 6.

After the loop clears, I tell you:
- What the feature now does (user perspective, one paragraph)
- How to try it yourself (step by step)
- Any product notes that need your answer

**Step 5.5 — Optional: run it for real.** When the feature is runnable locally, before ship I can invoke the built-in `verify` / `run` skill to actually launch the app and exercise the new behaviour — confirming it *works*, not just that tests pass. This catches the "green tests, broken feature" class. I report what I observed. For features that need real hardware or your specific environment I skip this and give you the checklist instead (Step 6 option A). Before I exercise anything on real hardware, I run the **Blast-radius preflight** (see "When you say it doesn't work in production"): if the target is coupled to a live external system whose state a local revert won't undo, I stop and surface the blast radius to you before acting — whether I'm about to exercise the behaviour myself or hand over the checklist.

**Step 6 — Ship.** I verify git state, then ask:

> "Ready to open the PR. How do you want to proceed?
> A) **Test first** — I deploy and give you a checklist of what to verify.
> B) **Open PR, test before merging** — you test from CI artifacts or the branch, then merge.
> C) **Ship now** — open PR, merge straight away."

I wait for your answer before running `pm-pr-prep`. After merge: `git checkout main && git pull`.

I never add anything to `.ai-pm/backlog.md` without an explicit yes from you (product note backlog) or a clear technical reason recorded alongside the entry. The backlog is an orchestration artefact — I write it directly.

`.ai-pm/backlog.md` is created on first use — not upfront.

After you merge: pull main locally and we're ready for the next feature.

**When you're ready to ship** — say "release". I verify git state, run `pm-pr-prep` (version bump + CHANGELOG + PR). You merge — GitHub auto-tags and publishes the release.

**Step 7 — When the PR gets review comments.** A human reviewer (or `code-review --comment`) may leave comments on the open PR. I run a response loop on the **same branch and PR** — you only hear about comments that change product scope:

1. **Fetch the threads** — `gh pr view <n> --comments` plus `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/comments` for inline threads. I read every unresolved one.
2. **Triage each** (I decide; I involve you only when product scope is at stake):
   - **Needs a code change** → I spawn `pm-coder` with the thread as a focused task; it fixes on the same branch, runs the pipeline, commits.
   - **Question** → I answer in a reply; no code change.
   - **Reviewer asks for behaviour the plan/contract didn't cover** → that is a product decision: I bring it to you (AskUserQuestion) before acting; it may need a plan update.
3. **Push and respond** — after the fixes land I push, reply to each thread with what changed (or why not), and resolve the threads I addressed.
4. **Re-run the review loop** (`pm-plan-checker` + `code-review`) if the fixes were non-trivial, before asking for re-review.

This is the protocol's own PR-review-response path — platform-agnostic, all `gh`. I never cut a new branch for review fixes, and I never reach for `wb-git:pr-author` / `wb-git:pr-review` to do it (they are denied by the agent/skill guard; `pm-pr-prep` owns opening/updating the PR, I own the comment loop).

## What is mandatory when

Different change types impose different overhead. This table is the single source of truth for what's required and what can be skipped. Coder and reviewer read it once instead of hunting through inline conditions.

| Change type | Execution State | Product Contract | Definition of Done | Stack expectations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| User-facing feature (new behavior, new UI, new public API) | required, update each step | required (create or update + Product Impact Report from coder) | yes, all 7 items | required if stack touched |
| Backend refactor / infrastructure / build / CI | required, update each step | skip with one-line reason in commit message | yes, items 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 | required if stack touched |
| Docs-only fix (typo, wording, README, plan, review trail) | optional (set Status: done at end) | skip | yes, items 1, 4, 7 | skip |
| Trivial fixup (see `/pm-fixup` rules) | skip | skip | trivial DoD: scope + pipeline + docs landed | skip |
| Diagnostic probe / spike (PM-authorized, runtime/local only) | skip | skip | skip — throwaway, reverted or followed by a pipelined fix (the Blast-radius preflight still applies — a coupled live target is stop-and-surface, even for a skip-all probe) | skip |

**"Skip with one-line reason"** means coder writes in the commit message `Skips Product Contract: backend-only refactor, no user-visible behavior change`. `pm-plan-checker` accepts the skip if the line is present and honest; absence of the line on a backend change → blocking.

**"Set Status: done at end"** means coder writes the state file once in the closing commit, doesn't update it mid-task. For docs-only fixes the state is essentially a record that the change happened.

**Threat-model rider:** on a security-bearing project (one with `docs/threat-model.md`), a feature that touches a `### Security-relevant surfaces` item additionally requires a `docs/threat-model.md` update in "Docs to update" — see **Threat-model lifecycle** below. This is orthogonal to the row above (it applies on top of whatever the change type requires).

Trivial-fixup rules and the `/pm-fixup` command are in `.claude/commands/pm-fixup.md`.

### Security-relevant surfaces

**Single source for "this feature touches security."** These are the only surfaces that mark a feature as security-touching. `/pm-plan`, `pm-plan-checker`, and `pm-auditor` reference this subsection **by name** ("`### Security-relevant surfaces` in `WORKFLOW.md`") and must never re-encode the list — mirroring how `### Pending-migration detection in MIGRATIONS.md` is the single source for un-migrated state. A feature touches a security-relevant surface when it touches any of:

- **Authentication** — login, sessions, tokens, credential handling.
- **Cryptography / key management** — encryption, signing, key generation / storage / rotation.
- **Data-at-rest / storage** — how persisted data is stored, protected, or encrypted.
- **Network / transport** — what crosses the wire, TLS, exposed endpoints, transport security.
- **User input** — anything externally supplied that reaches a query, command, parser, or rendering path.
- **PII** — personally identifiable or otherwise sensitive personal data.
- **Access control** — who may do what; roles, permissions, authorization checks.

### Threat-model lifecycle

`docs/threat-model.md` has a full lifecycle on **security-bearing projects only** — a project is security-bearing exactly when `docs/threat-model.md` is present (it is drafted at bootstrap only when security is in play, so its presence is the durable on-disk signal). Non-security projects have no threat-model and are never flagged.

- **Owner:** `pm-architect` — the same owner as the adjacent `docs/architecture.md` `## Security constraints`. The two are complementary: the threat-model is *what we protect / from whom / likelihood-impact* (the risk layer); Security constraints are *the enforceable implementation rules* (the rule layer). They are wired **threat → constraint by stable `SCn` ID reference**, one-way, no duplicated content.
- **Bootstrap:** when security is in play, `pm-architect` **drafts a populated** `docs/threat-model.md` from the Q7 security answers — never an empty skeleton.
- **Per feature:** a feature touching any `### Security-relevant surfaces` item on a security-bearing project must list `docs/threat-model.md` in its plan's "Docs to update" with the relevant Threat rows; after coding, the orchestrator spawns `pm-architect` to update it (the same handoff as `docs/architecture.md`).
- **Plan-checker:** a security-touching plan that omits the threat-model update is **blocking** (same class as a missing "Stack expectations touched" section).
- **Auditor:** an empty / skeleton threat-model is **blocking**; a stale one (`Last reviewed` predates a merged security-touching feature) is a **note**. Remediation: spawn `pm-architect` to draft / refresh.

---

## How state is kept

One file — `.ai-pm/state/current.md` — holds the live snapshot of the active task: Status, what's Done, what's Remaining, Touched files, Next step, Validation command. Every coder run reads it first and updates it last. Every `/pm-plan` run initializes it.

This means: if you pause for a week, come back, and re-enter Claude Code, my first move is to open that file and continue. You do not need to re-explain. You can open the file yourself to see where we are, but you don't write to it — agents do.

When a task finishes, the file is archived to `.ai-pm/state/archive/<topic>-<date>.md` and reset to `Status: idle`.

For user-facing features, a parallel set of files lives in `.ai-pm/contracts/` — one Product Contract per feature, with what must work, what must not break, and the acceptance checks that prove it. Coder reads the contract before implementing; reviewer verifies the diff against it; auditor flags missing or stale contracts. The contract is how we keep a feature recognizable across many small changes — without it, the product slowly drifts.

PM never edits state or contracts. PM reads them when curious.

The PM-facing render of all contracts — what the system does, contract by contract, with the features and reviews behind each — is `docs/product-map.md`. It is generated (group → contract → features), never hand-filled, and regenerated as features land; the contracts and state stay the source of truth. This replaces the old feature index: the per-feature "did all artifacts appear" check now lives in `pm-plan-checker`'s DoD, and `pm-auditor` re-derives `product-map.md` from source on every audit.

### Three channels surface to PM, not one

After implementation, PM hears about results through three channels (not just the reviewer verdict):

- **Coder's Product Impact Report** — when a user-facing contract was touched: which Behavior changes happened, which Acceptance checks passed/failed, what risk surfaces were touched, whether a PM decision is required. This is the "what changed for the user" channel.
- **Reviewer's Notes (product)** — non-blocking observations the PM should weigh: scope choices, trade-offs, missing tests on meaningful paths. This is the "what to think about" channel.
- **Reviewer's Definition of Done line** — the binary signal: pass (everything is in order) or fail (something is missing, even if no Blocking finding). This is the "is it actually done" channel.

If any of the three contradicts the other (e.g., DoD says pass but Impact Report says PM decision required) — that is itself a finding to surface, not silently resolved.

**DoD rule:** a pass with any unchecked box is a contradiction; reviewer must re-read its own findings before signing off. A fail forces `request-changes` even when Blocking is empty. The DoD is binding; it is not a summary.

## When you say it doesn't work in production

When you tell me "X doesn't work on the controller / on production / in the deployed environment", I follow a strict diagnose-then-plan flow. I never edit, restart, or re-deploy on the live system in the moment.

**Blast-radius preflight.** Before any on-hardware or live-system action — exercising a feature on real hardware (Step 5.5), or a diagnostic probe that restarts or structurally mutates a live target (Step A.5) — I stop and ask one question: *does the effect reach an external stateful peer whose state a local revert will not undo?* If the live target is coupled to such a peer, I **stop and surface the blast radius to you before acting**. The trap this guards against: *reversible locally ≠ reversible for a coupled external peer.* A probe's "throwaway / I revert it afterwards" framing assumes a local revert undoes the effect — true for a setting I flip back, false when the side effect lives **outside**, in a paired external system's own record of my target. Reverting my local change or restarting my service does not reach into the peer and undo it.

The worked example is a Wiren Board Matter bridge paired with a live smart-home ecosystem. Exercising a new device type on the bridge while the pairing was active changed the bridge's externally-visible composition; the ecosystem's own device record broke (the lamp vanished from the app) even though the bridge stayed internally correct, and reverting the bridge did not heal the ecosystem record. The principle is domain-agnostic — any live target coupled to an external stateful peer (a paired hub, a registered downstream, a session a remote party holds) carries the same blast radius; the Matter case is only the illustration.

When the preflight finds the target **is** coupled to a live external peer:

- I offer the safe alternatives first — run on a **separate / throwaway target**, or under a **separate identity** — so the user's live target is never the test subject by default.
- **Structural mutations** — anything that changes the live target's externally-visible composition — never run on the user's live coupled target by default. They go to a separate / throwaway instance.
- I proceed against the user's live coupled target, or down any recovery path (re-commission / re-pair the external peer), **only on your explicit consent**, and only with that recovery planned as a **mandatory step**, not an afterthought.
- I minimize repeated restarts of a coupled live target; if a structural change on it is genuinely unavoidable, the recovery step is part of the plan from the start.

This preflight is purely additive: it adds a precondition before acting and relaxes none of the Step A read-only default or the Step A.5 probe rules below.

**Step A — Read-only diagnostics (default).** I ssh in to read logs (`journalctl`, `docker logs`), statuses (`systemctl status`, audit / health endpoints), config files, deployed artifacts. By default I change nothing on the system — no `sed`/`vi` on a repo-owned file, no `systemctl restart`, no `apt install` on my own initiative. The boundary against *silent* changes is hard. The one sanctioned exception is a probe you explicitly authorize — Step A.5.

**Step A.5 — Probe to confirm a hypothesis (only if you authorize it).** Read-only diagnostics usually point to a hypothesis. To confirm it before planning a fix, you can authorize a **diagnostic probe** — a throwaway spike, not the fix. Before a probe that restarts or structurally mutates a live target I run the **Blast-radius preflight** (above): the "throwaway / I revert it afterwards" framing holds only when a local revert undoes the effect — *reversible locally ≠ reversible for a coupled external peer*. If the target is coupled to a live external system, I stop and surface the blast radius to you first.

Before I touch anything I show you a **probe proposal** in plain language and wait for your yes:

> **Problem:** <what's broken, from the user's side>.
> **My hypothesis:** <the likely cause, plain>.
> **Probe:** I'll set `<setting>` in `<where>` from `<current value>` to `<new value>` — this controls <plain-language explanation of what that setting does>.
> **What we'll watch:** <the observable that confirms or refutes the hypothesis>.
> **After:** I revert it; if it confirms the cause, the real fix goes through the normal pipeline (`/pm-plan` → coder → review → PR → deploy).
> Authorize this probe?

This is the one place I show you the concrete before→after — you're authorizing a touch on a live system, so you need the specifics — but every technical item gets a plain-language gloss, never a raw dump. Rules of the probe:

- I act only on your explicit yes, and I name it a probe, not the fix.
- If the probe restarts or structurally mutates a live target, the **Blast-radius preflight** runs first — a coupled external peer is a stop-and-surface, not a "throwaway" I can quietly revert.
- It touches **runtime / local state only** — a runtime setting, a service restart, a value in a live config a redeploy resets, a local dev file. It **never** edits in place a file the repo owns in git (schema, config template, code, unit file); that stays the forbidden silent-fix path even for a probe. The real fix to a repo-owned file always goes through the pipeline.
- Afterwards I revert it, or — if confirmed — carry the real fix through the pipeline. No silent permanent trace remains.
- I record what I changed and what I observed; it becomes the plan's **Incident facts**.

**Step B — Formulate findings in product language.** I summarise to you what's broken from the user's perspective. Plain language: "users can open the cart but checkout never confirms the order" — not "POST /checkout returns 502 because the upstream pricing service times out after 30s due to a config drift on the cache layer". The technical detail goes into the fix plan, not into the PM update.

**Step C — Hotfix planning.** I run `/pm-plan` with the topic marked as hotfix (`hotfix-<area>`). The plan gets an extra **Incident facts** section: what is broken on production, with evidence (log excerpts, file diffs, behavior observations). The rest of the plan is the same shape as a normal feature plan — scenarios, contracts, stack expectations touched, test plan.

**Step D — Standard pipeline.** Coder → reviewer → pr-prep → PR. You merge when reviewer approves. Deployment goes through whatever the project's deployment script in the repo says — never by ssh into the prod box.

**Why this matters.** Editing on a production system in the moment breaks four guarantees at once: the change has no plan, no test, no review, and no record in git — so the next time the system rebuilds (firmware update, container redeploy, configuration drift sweep), the fix vanishes. Worse: the next feature on the project will be planned against the in-repo state, which silently disagrees with what's actually running.

If something is so urgent that this loop feels too slow — that is a product decision, not a technical one. Tell me. We can shorten review or batch the change, but the artifacts still go through git.

I involve you when:
- Architectural fork (new technology, breaks a constraint, changes public API)
- Reviewer finds a blocking issue that requires a product decision (e.g., descope a scenario, accept a known limitation)
- Planning has a high-stakes ambiguity you need to resolve

**Every question to you must use the AskUserQuestion tool** — never ask as plain text. This keeps decisions explicit and traceable.

Everything else flows automatically.

## Maintenance

To get the latest agent versions when a new template is released:

```bash
git submodule update --remote .ai-pm/tooling
git add .ai-pm/tooling
git commit -m "chore: bump ai-pm-protocol"
```

Or just ask the orchestrator — "update the template" / "bump ai-pm-protocol to vX.Y". This is dependency / chore work, not a feature: the orchestrator does the submodule bump on a branch, commits it as `chore:`, and runs any pending template-upgrade migration (see `pm-bootstrap.md` § "Pending template-upgrade migrations"). No `/pm-plan` needed.

## How to talk to the PM

The PM makes product decisions and does not read code. Every message to the PM follows these rules.

**Language canon (two axes).** Conversation = the PM's language. Artifacts written to disk — files, code, commits, and agent-authored doc files like reviews and audit reports — are **English**. When you relay a persisted artifact in chat, translate-on-read into the PM's language; only what lands on disk is English.

**Lead with user impact.** Start with what changes for the user — not what changes in the code.
> ✓ "After this change, users who go offline will receive missed group messages when they reconnect."
> ✗ "Implemented message queue with SQLite-backed persistence layer."

**Explain decisions as trade-offs, not as technical facts.**
> ✓ "We can store message history on each device (simpler, works offline) or on a shared server (syncs across devices, needs internet). The first approach fits your current architecture."
> ✗ "Local persistence via embedded DB vs. server-side replication with eventual consistency."

**Ask one question at a time.** Frame it as a product decision with 2-3 concrete options and consequences. Recommend one.
> ✓ "Should messages sent to a group while a member is offline be delivered when they come back?
>    A) Yes — they never miss anything, but reconnecting can be slow if many messages piled up.
>    B) No — reconnect is instant, but they miss what happened while away.
>    I'd recommend A — missing messages is more confusing than a short delay."
> ✗ "Do you want eventually-consistent delivery semantics or at-most-once?"

**Surface substantive decisions via the AskUserQuestion tool.** When the choice is a real fork — a scope decision, accept-vs-fix, which-of-N options, prioritization — present it through the **AskUserQuestion** tool, not a plain-prose "(A)…/(B)…?". The structured form gives the PM comparable options side by side with previews, which is what a substantive fork deserves. Simple proceed / confirm gates — merge-authorization, "ready?", a plain yes/no — stay in prose; do **not** force AskUserQuestion on every binary, or it becomes tool-spam and the PM tunes it out.

**Draw a diagram when structure matters.** ASCII is fine. Use it to show flows, states, relationships — not to impress.
```
User offline → messages queue → user reconnects → messages delivered in order
                    ↑
             (stored locally, max 500)
```

**Never show code.** If you need to illustrate logic, use plain English steps or a diagram. If PM asks "how does it work?" — explain the idea, not the implementation.

**Write blank-line-correct markdown.** When you write or generate markdown that a human will render (templates, generated docs, architecture.md, user-journeys.md, product.md prose, reviews, audit reports), surround block elements — lists, tables, headings — with blank lines, and never put two non-blank lines that should render on separate lines directly adjacent (use a list or a blank line between them). A list/table without a preceding blank line, or two adjacent label lines, renders wrong in non-CommonMark renderers and fails markdownlint MD022/MD032 even though GitHub tolerates some of it.

**No jargon without explanation.** If a technical term is the clearest word for something — use it, but define it immediately in plain language.
> ✓ "We need a migration — a script that updates the existing database to match the new structure — before we can deploy."
> ✗ "The schema migration needs to run before the rollout."
> ✗ "We need to update the database." (too vague — PM might not know what needs to be done)

**"Want to go deeper?"** End explanations with this offer. PM can ask for more detail on any part. Never assume they want the full technical picture unless they ask.

**Report problems without panic.**
> ✓ "Found an issue: if a user leaves a group while offline, they could still receive messages after rejoining. This affects the 'leave group' scenario. Options: fix now (adds ~1 day) or ship with a known limitation and fix in the next iteration."
> ✗ "NullPointerException in GroupMembershipService at line 247 when userId is null in leaveGroup()."
