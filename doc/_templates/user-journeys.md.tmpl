# User Journeys

How users interact with the product — step by step. Written for humans and read by agents before planning any feature.

One journey per key user role. Focus on decision points and what can go wrong — not UI details.

## Journey 1: <Role> — <Journey name>

**Entry context:** what happened in the user's life that brought them to this product.

Write each step in plain human language: what the person *does*, what they *expect to see or get*, and what *can go wrong* from their point of view. No protocol identifiers in the step bodies — no topic names, field names, status codes, message-retention or quality-of-service flags. If a step depends on such a value, describe its effect in human terms ("the system remembers the last reading and shows it immediately") and let the format live in `docs/architecture.md` `## Behavioral contract (taxonomies & invariants)`.

| Step | What the user does | What they expect | What can go wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. | <plain-language action — e.g., "scans the device's QR code"> | <what they expect — e.g., "the app recognizes the device and shows its name"> | <human failure mode — e.g., "code is unreadable; nothing happens"> |
| 2. | <action> | <expectation> | |
| 3. | <action> | <expectation> | |
| N. | <exit / completion> | <expectation> | |

**Drop-off points:** where the user might give up or get confused.

**Invariants:** what must be true at each step for this journey to work — stated at the human level only (e.g., "the device must already be paired", "the user must have confirmed the previous step"). Any format or taxonomy invariant — a status enumeration, an identifier grammar, a retention or quality-of-service rule, a reachability guarantee — does **not** belong here. State it once in `docs/architecture.md` `## Behavioral contract (taxonomies & invariants)` and reference that section from the journey; never restate the identifiers here beside a link, because a copy-beside-a-link drifts.

## Cross-journey interactions

If multiple user roles interact (e.g., sender ↔ receiver, admin ↔ user), describe the interaction points here.
